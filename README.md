# About
I launched a marathon walk in 21 June 2024! A mega-walk from Penrith to Pyrmont, 2 cities in Sydney, Australia. As a walking enthusiast and to practice my web design skills too, I launched this website and initiative.

# Tech stack
It took me a week to get it all coded, designed and deployed. I cloned my own boilerplate/template which you can find here: https://github.com/emanoj1/boilerplate-react-node-js  
The tech stack: React, NodeJS, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
