        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div className="faq">

          <h4>What is the Penrith to Pyrmont Walk?</h4>
          <p>The Penrith to Pyrmont Walk is a personal initiative by Manoj Kumar, who has spent significant time in both Penrith and Pyrmont. 
            Having frequently walked between Pyrmont & Chatswood and Pyrmont & Summer Hill, Manoj envisioned an even more exciting journey between Penrith & Pyrmont. 
            This idea took shape in early 2024, and planning commenced in June 2024. 
            You can learn more about Manoj later on this page!
          </p>

          <h4>What is the distance of the walk?</h4>
          <p>The walk covers a distance of 65 kilometers from Penrith to Pyrmont.</p>

          <h4>How long does it take to complete the walk?</h4>
          <p>The walk takes approximately 15 hours non-stop, though this can vary depending on an individual’s pace.</p>

          <h4>What is the plan to complete the walk?</h4>
          <p>Initially, the plan was to complete the walk in one day. However, after careful consideration, it was decided to split it over two days. 
            On the first day, we will walk from Penrith to Parramatta, which is about 33 km and will take approximately 8 hours. 
            The next day, we will continue from Parramatta to Pyrmont, covering the remaining 22 km in about 5 hours. 
            Breaks, lunch, and photo opportunities will be included, making it a full and enjoyable experience!
            </p>

          <h4>What is the walking route?</h4>
          <p>You can refer to the map on the homepage or search for Penrith Station to Pyrmont Station online to view the route. 
            In summary, we will be walking along the path adjacent to all the train stations on the way. 
            This keeps us close to shops, people, and necessary facilities like restrooms.</p>

          <h4>Who can participate?</h4>
          <p>The walk is open to individuals over 18 years old who are medically fit. 
            Due to the strenuous nature of the walk, prior experience with long-distance walking is highly recommended. 
            Participants can rest at their own pace if needed and can discontinue the walk and use public transport if they choose.
          </p>

          <h4>What should I carry with me?</h4>
          <p>
          Here are some recommendations: energy snacks, lunch, a water bottle, a towel, a mobile phone charger and power banks, a travel card for public transport, a hat or cap, 
          sunscreen, sunglasses, headphones, fitness trackers, and any personal medications. 
          It's also wise to bring ointments and a medical kit to manage blisters and sore feet.
          </p>

          <h4>What about footwear?</h4>
          <p>
          You will need high-quality long-distance walking shoes. Casual sneakers and regular shoes won’t suffice. 
          Your shoes should provide stability and have wide soles near the forefoot for toe space. Choose something sturdy and specifically designed for long walks. 
          The walking path is entirely flat, consisting of cemented footpaths. Also, make sure to wear comfortable socks. 
          </p>

          <h4>Do I get trophies and certificates?</h4>
          <p>
          Currently, there are no plans for trophies due to cost constraints and the lack of a sponsor. 
          If your business can sponsor trophies, we’d love to feature your logo on our homepage for that year’s event! 
          Certificates are more affordable and something we might consider. We’ll keep you posted. If you have other ideas, feel free to email us!
            </p>

          <h4>Who do I contact for further clarifications?</h4>
          <p>For more information, you can reach out to Manoj via the Contact page, and he will respond to your queries.</p>

          <h4>What else should I know?</h4>
          <p>This walk is a personal project and not sponsored by any government, fitness body, or charitable organization. 
            We are a group of enthusiasts who gather to enjoy the walk. As such, we are not responsible for any issues that may arise during the walk, including injuries or illnesses.
